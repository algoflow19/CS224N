### Final Project: Deep Learning based Authorship Identification
- Report: [__PDF__](project/report/report.pdf)

__Abstract__: Authorship identification is an important topic in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). It enables us to identify the most likely author of articles, news or messages. Authorship identification can be applied to tasks such as identifying anonymous author, detecting plagiarism or finding ghost writer. In this project, we tackled this problem at different levels, with different deep learning models and on different datasets. Among all models we tested, article-level GRU achieves the best result of 69.1% accuracy on C50 dataset and 89.2% on Guternberg dataset. We further studied authorship verification, on which task our Siamese network- based model outputs 99.8% accuracy on both C50 and Gutenberg.
